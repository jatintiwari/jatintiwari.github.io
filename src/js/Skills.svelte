            With over {yearOfExperience} years of experience in front-end development, I have had the privilege to work with
            small to very large-scale e-commerce companies for approximately {yearOfExperience - 1} years. My expertise lies
            in Web and App development with advanced knowledge in Javascript.

            During my tenure at<a class="cta" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furlenco" target="_blank">Furlenco</a
            >, I started working with <span class="highlight">React JS</span>, which quickly became my favorite
            framework. I have prior experience with <span class="highlight">Angular JS</span> and
            <span class="highlight">Backbone JS</span>
            as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to my proficiency in Javascript, I am enthusiastic about <span class="highlight"
                >Puppeteer JS</span
            >
            and can quickly build a scalable API in <span class="highlight">NodeJS</span>. During my time at
            <a class="cta" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipkart" target="_blank">Flipkart</a>, I created a
            Visual Regression tool that automated the process of taking screenshots of all the app workflows and
            comparing them to baseline checkpoint images. This tool eliminated manual testing and improved the
            efficiency of the testing process.

            I ❤️ building apps from scratch and scaling them to serve millions of customers. I believe
            that technology should be used on a need basis and that it takes time to build high-quality apps. I have
            helped several friends kickstart their startup dreams by building native apps using <span class="highlight"
                >Flutter</span
            >
            and <span class="highlight">React Native</span>.
