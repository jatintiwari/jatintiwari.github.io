        <p>
            I have ~{yearOfExperience} years of experience in frontend development. For ~5.5 years I have worked with e-commerce companies.
        </p>
        <p>I have advance knowledge in Web and App development.</p>
        <p>
            I have expertise in <span class="text-bold">Javascript</span>. These days I am using
            <span class="highlight">React JS</span>. I also have prior experience with <span class="highlight">Angular JS</span> and <span class="highlight">Backbone JS</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am enthusiastic about <span class="highlight">Puppeteer JS</span> and can very quickly build a scalable API in
            <span class="highlight">NodeJS</span>. While working with
            <a class="cta" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipkart" target="_blank">Flipkart</a>, I had created a Visual Regression tool which
            was able to take screenshots of all the app workflows and then assert baseline with checkpoint images.

        <p>
            I ❤️ <span class="text-italic">building apps from scratch</span> and then scale them to serve millions of cusomters. I also believe
            that it takes time to build such apps and use of technology is as per need basis.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have helped a few friends to kick off their startup dream with native apps in <span class="highlight">Flutter</span>
            and <span class="highlight">React native</span>.
