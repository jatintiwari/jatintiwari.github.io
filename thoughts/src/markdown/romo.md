# Reality of missing out

---

I stumbled on to this term ROMO and then pondered on it. I have gone back to my childhood, teenage and to recent years to explore my missing out feelings.

### Fear of missing out

For me, FOMO is a feeling that I get when I feel anxious about not being able to do or get something.

My FOMOs that stayed for long time -

-   Missing out on school's basketball team.
-   Not being invited to a birthday party.
-   Not having a computer at home to show off about the cool stuff I know.
-   Knowing cool kids around me.
-   Not getting gifts for my birthday or from foreign relatives.
-   Not having a motorcycle to go to school.
-   Not having much advantages i.e. status, money.
-   Not being able to travel to luxurious destinations.
-   Not working in a cool enough company.
-   Not getting promoted.
-   Not being able to relocate to a different country.

... and so on!

All the above scenarios, when they occurred in my life, I was unaware of my feelings and did nothing to harness my emotions.

<mark>I am an emotional person, and also unaware of their types!</mark>

> These feelings amplified as I looked more outside than inside. I could have controlled my mind, had I tried, but not the outside world.

These feelings can be easily categorized into type of emotions with the help of the [emotional wheel](https://humansystems.co/emotionwheels/).

</figure>

My most prevalent emotions according to the Emotion Wheel are -

-   Rage
    -   To hate the cause of the suffering.
    -   Get into _the fight mode_ for everything.
-   Anxious
    -   About the outcome of an interview.
    -   About a reply for the invitation.
-   Envy
    -   Not having better or at least similar outcome.
-   Sadness
    -   Feeling dejected after a break up with a friend or a girlfriend.
    -   Not finding connection of thoughts with an important person.

All these years, **I did not stop and introspect myself**. I was just flowing with the time.

<details>
<summary>During my early 20s, I was in "Work Hard, Party Harder" mode and It lasted till my late 20s.</summary>
 <p></p>It was all due to fear of missing out [ on next promotion, pay hike, office gossip, partying in a new club, <strong>FRIYAY rituals</strong>]. <em>Things you do to get accepted.</em> Irregular sleep pattern, unhealthy eating habits, and work hours helped me gain more than a few Kilos, constant back pain and hair loss.
 I am very energetic person, But I was not having enough energy throughout the day and only during towards the end. I consulted a doctor to be advised to change this routine - Enough Said!

<h2>Things are changing</h2>  
</article>

---

I still have FOMOs but the better ones üòÅ. I do not distract myself from these fearful and doubtful feelings instead, I embrace them. I spend time to analyze the cause and form a conclusion which I can remind myself, when I experience the same feelings again. **I have made goals and focus on my routine around achieving those goals**.

> I have started my journey inwards. To get to know myself.

Now, my morning starts with training session rather than last night's hangover. Now, my office commute is enriched with daily podcasts related to Tech, Productivity, and Business rather than playing a shuffle playlist. Now, During office hours, I am more relaxed and focused due to an awesome start rather than slacking through the day. Now, I am happy to reach home to complete yet another milestone in the video game I am playing rather hanging out for a cocktail. Now, I wind down my day while reading a book rather than doom scrolling social media.

### It is never too late to begin

---

My aim is to be aware, redirect my emotional energy, rather than falling to the consequences of fear and doubt. Starting with small steps, I have made some intertwining habits.

> Do things you love and talk about what you love and you‚Äôll attract people who love that kind of stuff. It‚Äôs that simple.
> -- Austin Kleon

#### Social media

---

I have **quit social media**, and have confined the usage for LinkedIn and Reddit. These apps are installed on a device which is not in my reach, for maximum part of the day.

I use Reddit to follow the general awareness around me with subs like [IndianStockMarket](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/), [bangalore](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/), [developersIndia](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/).

I have ** removed Online Shopping apps** from my phone. I have them on my iPad as I still purchase things online and even do window shopping but it is limited now.

#### Lifestyle

---

> _21 days to form a habit is a myth_. ** I believe it takes multiple 21 days cycle to form a habit.**

In Amazon, there is a saying, "We all have good intentions, but the process will make us successful". I have had good intention to change to my lifestyle from last couple of years but it is only from this year beginning that I have formed a mechanism and followed it.

My weekday routine, I derail sometimes, but that is OK!

Now, This sorts only the 5 days of the week, not the elephant in the week - The Weekend. üòÅ

I keep my weekends for long and engaging tasks. I plan my upcoming weekend during the week, and prioritize things to be taken up during weekend. I like going out for a breakfast, long walks around [Agara Lake](https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297628-d4422048-Reviews-Agara_Lake-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html), visit [Cubbon park](https://www.holidify.com/places/bangalore/cubbon-park-sightseeing-1286.html).

Once in a while, I get together with my friends during the evenings and [We go out for drinks](https://www.zomato.com/bangalore/microbreweries).

My weekends are the reward for keeping up a routine throughout the week. üòé

#### Health

<small>Not an advise, just what I do!</small>

Similarly, We get this body only once. -- <a class="small" alt="warren buffett quote" target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/587506-when-i-was-sixteen-i-had-just-two-things-on#:~:text=Sign%20Up%20Now-,When%20I%20was%20sixteen%2C%20I%20had%20just%20two%20things%20on,had%20more%20luck%20with%20cars.">Warren Buffett</a>

-   **Food** - I monitor my macros - Carb, Protein, and Fat. I alter the consumption based on where I am, and the work I am doing, but prefer eating good fats, lean protein and minimum carbs.
     <details>
     <summary>
     My Food related changes are inspired by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.in/Diabetes-Code-Prevent-Reverse-Naturally/dp/8194967414">The Diabetes Code</a>
     </summary>
     I have paternal family history of diet disorder. We are prone to type 2 diabetes . Anything with high Glycemic Index will spike our blood glucose.
     </details>

    I try to consume less of processed/refined products in any form - sugar, oil, flour, rice, meat. I have transitioned towards gluten-free and millet enriched flour and rice for daily consumptions. Biggest change here is that **I keep restricted intake of sugar.**

    I prefer eating [Poha](https://www.google.com/search?q=poha), [Millet Dosa](https://www.google.com/search?q=millet+dosa) for breakfast and lentils/vegetables during lunch. I have added Eggs and Whey Protein in my diet, I generally have one of them along with my breakfast.

    <details>
        <summary>I am a foodie but I am mindful and eat in small portions.</summary>
        I ‚ù§Ô∏è home style curries and often cook them, but for the healthy eating purpose I have moved to explore roast and grill cooking options.
    </details>

    I avoid beer but I ‚ù§Ô∏è whisky. I have reduced the occurence of consumption to weekends only but I am still working on reducing the quantity of intakes. ‚úåüèΩ

-   **Regular Blood work** - I monitor my vitals and make changes as per consultation. Only the vitals can validate the changes.
    I am suspected to Type 2 Diabetes and it was evident in my blood report. Full body checkup reported that my `HbA1c` was in the range of pre-diabetes.

-   **Fasting** - Fasting for 24 hours has been the game changer. I start my week with a fast on Monday i.e. I take my last meal on Sunday afternoon and then next meal on Monday afternoon. I prefer doing it on WFH days, to prevent any extraneous energy required for commute.

    Rest of the days, I take my last meal of the day before sunset i.e. ~6PM and then break the fast next day at 9AM.

    Initially my weight drastically reduced from 74 Kgs to 69Kgs and now is stable near 64kgs. I weigh myself after I get up in the morning and before going to bed to avgerage my weight.(Not everydayüë∫).

-   **Gym** - It is the last but very important to maintain a good health. I am super energetic, I use this pent up energy in the gym for strength training. I am able to see the results with better eating habits(covered in Food) and training. I train at least 4 times a week.

#### Hobbies

---

-   **Being Passionately Curious** - Since my childhood, I tear down & open all my toys to know more about how they work. I still do it, but now I am exploring my interests with a Raspberry Pi.

-   **Reading** - I have got this from my mother - "Books are friends". I was never a sitter, so reading a book was more of muscle training than mind.

    I like reading tech design docs, articles and books - [Build by Tony Fadell](https://www.amazon.in/Build-Lead-Title-Unorthodox-Making/dp/1787634116), [System Design by Alex Xu](https://www.amazon.in/System-Design-Interview-Insiders-Guide/dp/B098G1Y91Z)

    I read self books to be productive and form habits - Think and Grow Rich, Digital minimalism, Deep work are the recent ones.

    My favorites auto/biographies are [Shoe dog by Phil Knight](https://www.amazon.in/Shoe-Dog-Memoir-Creator-NIKE/dp/1471146723), [Snowball - Warren Buffett](https://www.amazon.in/Snowball-Warren-Buffett-Business-Life/dp/1408887010).

    I read on kindle and never run out of books üòÅ.

-   **Podcasts** - I tend to keep away from endless Youtube playback. I agree podcast are more likely as same as video content but as of now, there is a lot less noise in this space. It takes patience and consistency to focus and not loose concentration while listening. My podcast genres varies indistinctly.

    Tech - I binge listen [The Change log](https://changelog.com/podcast), [Syn Tax](https://syntax.fm/), [Developer Tea](https://developertea.com/)

    Bussiness - [Finshorts](https://podcasts.apple.com/in/podcast/finshots-daily/id1532901566), [Money Control](https://www.moneycontrol.com/podcast/)

-   **Video games** - Playing video games came naturally to me. I did not have to force a sitting for it.
    I play somewhere near an hour everyday. Recently, I have completed `God of War Ragnar√∂k` and loved it.

    I also like First Person Shooting games like Far Cry and GTA, and who doesn't like `Need for Speed` üöò

#### Long term view for

---

<small>This is not related to investment opportunities! üòÇ</small>

I do not see the instant benefits of these investments but I am optimistic that when the time comes, they will work as per the need.

**Body** - Already said enough, I believe it is once in a life time opportunity.

**Insurance** - My brother-in-law advised me to get a term life insurance, You never know!

**Build a Networth** - I have got the concept of _Fuck you_ money from my mentor, I think it is a MUST. I am investing in various risk free as well as risky instrumentsü§ûüèΩ. I believe that less you manage money, the more is grows, so I prefer to park it away from my reach for certain period. I can't time things, so I just invest in something and _patiently wait_ ü´•. It is all luck, and if you feel otherwise, good for you.

> I do not seek perfection and believe that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=anything+worth+doing+is+worth+doing+badly&oq=Anything+worth+doing+is+worth+doing+badly"> Anything that is worth doing is worth doing poorly.</a>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>  
</article>

---

My natural instincts have largely remained the same through out my life, but I am building another parallel personality to guide myself. It is like being guided by the energy which has a holistic view of the situation. Every action has good and bad consequences, my aim is maximize the good and keep a controlled bad influence.

#### ROMO - Reality of missing out

2020 Pandemic was a growth phase of my life. When each one of us were limited to our home, or a social bubble, I realized that I was concerned about the well being of a limited people in my life <sup>\*\*</sup>. I can picture the group while I am describing it here.

After all these years away from home, I was blessed to live ~2 years with my parents during pandemic. I noticed that both my parents have grown old and it is now visible on their faces. I missed catching up with them, not knowing them all these years while I busy being in FOMO.

-   My father retired from this Govt. service and I was not able to attend it.
-   My sibling has grown up and matured. Like from high school to even completed the post graduation.
-   I loved my dog, and I no more have him.
-   My dear friends have settled in their new lives after college.

I felt amazed about how far I have come, I am living my best life. Nature takes care of everything.

> I cannot have everything. While I do not have what I want, I do have what I need - My good health, career to grow, curiosity to explore.

Just like in a buffet, where we have unlimited items to eat, we still enjoy only a limited ones and repeat them. I focus on the things which I enjoy to eat, and only pay for it.

I follow my routine, take care of my loved ones, and carry out my hobbies. This is it. ‚úåüèΩ
