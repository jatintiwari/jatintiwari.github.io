<BlogHeader date="30 July 2023" title="Build a remote controlled Apple Music/Spotify jukebox."/>

### Motivation

I wake up to music and sleep on it. I passively listen to podcasts while doing my routine work.

### Behind the scene

I use my phones limitlessly for 3 years and then switch to a new device which ever is latest in market. I have recently switched my phone, but the old phone is still in decent shape. ðŸ˜·

I had two options with my old phone, Either I sell it at an undervalued price or keep it as a backup phone. In my opinion, the backup phone gets buried under dust as I rarely had a chance to use them, so the viable option was to sell it.

While I was there at the store to sell my phone, It came across my mind that I had imagined creating a jukebox for myself long time. I rushed back home to start creating one. ðŸš€

### Peripherals I am using

-   iPhone Xs
-   Wireless Charger
-   Speakers
-   Bluetooth remote (Mandatory)

#### Phone

---

Using a phone is not a mandate. It is can be any device as long as it can be connected to internet, has bluetooth, and can play music. I would recommend using any old generation Android phone, just in case you donot have a spare device.

The right device can add some good values as well.

-   Bluetooth - It can increase the efficiency of the complete setup if your phone has [Bluetooth 5.0](https://www.google.com/search?q=bluetooth+4.2+vs+5.0&oq=bluetooth+4&aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0i512l6j69i60.5415j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
-   Music Apps - Apple Music and Spotify can both stream losless music over bluetooth. I know it is loseless if a wireless network is involved, but the quality is still very superior in my opinion.
-   Album Art - The images which the music app display while playing the songs add a vibe to the area while the device is placed.

#### Wireless Charging

---

This helps in improving the asthetics of the corner where the device will be placed. My aim was that I should be able to access the device without un/plugging the charging wire.

I am using [RAEGR Arc 750 Wireless Charging Stand](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B09MYYPB12/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&th=1), but a simple phone stand with [L shaped charging cable](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B09KLVMZ3B/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) can be minimal viable option.

#### Speakers

---

Now this is a unit which depends on the quality of the music an individual is interested in listening. The options here are endless, so I will stick to one I am using. For this setup I have [Bose SoundLink Mini](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B014WEGG2K/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

I aspire to upgrade my speakers to a professional and a multi room setup. Also, I want to stream the music over WiFi, which will help me stream high fidelity music over greater distance and to more than one device at once.

#### Bluetooth remote

---

The bluetooth remote takes the complete setup to a different level. Till now what we have covered is a very conventional music experience with any other bluetooth speaker.

Most often, I play a background music while working and have to rush to pause it before heading into a hurdle. Imagine relaxing on the couch and being able to change the track playing on the app.

Bluetooth remote empowers you to control your device (Phone in my case) from a distance. Depending on the options available on the remote you can Play, Pause, Change track, Seek podcast, and Inc/Dec volume.

I have paired a remote with my phone and can control it from anywhere in my home. And as it is a Bluetooth remote, I donot have to be in sight of my phone. It works seemlessly from different rooms.

I am using a [Amazon Fire tv remote](https://www.amazon.in/AILKIN-amz-gen2-Firestick-Remote/dp/B0BQKQ4XDB/ref=asc_df_B0BQKQ4XDB/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=619685023632&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=3666418680147692663&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062008&hvtargid=pla-1955122155576&psc=1), It is yet another phased out device lying around in my home. There are many [affordable options](https://www.amazon.in/RC802V-Compatible-43S6500FS-49S6800FS-Non-Bluetooth/dp/B097ZQTDVZ/ref=sr_1_19?keywords=bluetooth+remote&qid=1690695745&sprefix=bluetooth+remote%2Caps%2C202&sr=8-19).

I would suggest to have remote which has the player controls.
